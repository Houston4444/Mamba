## Description

### Virtual MIDI Keyboard

Mamba comes with some predefined key-maps, qwertz, qwerty, azerty(fr) and azerty(be), but you could define your own
with the included Key-map Editor as well. Beside the computer keyboard and mouse, Mamba supports jack MIDI in and
ALSA (seq) MIDI in. Output goes to jack MIDI out. Every channel use it's own Colour to display the played Notes per channel.

### 16 Channel Live MIDI Looper: 

To record a loop, press "Play" and then to start recording press "Record".
To stop recording press record again. Playback will start immediately.

The first recorded channel will become the Master channel. This one set the time frame for all later recorded loops.
For the Master Channel the recording time will be stretched/clipped to match the next full beat time point.

To record a new loop, switch to a other channel, select your instrument and press "Record" again to start recording.

The later recorded loops will be synced to the master loop. When the recording time extend the absolute Master loop time
record will be switched off. Absolute time is not bound to the loop point, so you could record loops crossing it.
You could as well stop recording by press "Record" again before the time expires.

Each Channel could be cleared and re-recorded separate at any time.
even when you press "Record" on a already recorded channel, it will be cleared before recording starts.

You could record the connected input device or play the Keyboard itself.

### MIDI File player

You could select a MIDI file with the File Selector. It will be loaded in the play buffer of the first channel,
regardless how much channels it use. You could use then channel 2 - 16 to record your own playing into it.
To play along with it you could use any channel.
A loaded file will become the Master channel for the looper.

To save your work just go to Menu -> "File" -> "Save MIDI file as", select the path and enter a file name.
If you don't give the usual file extension Mamba will add the extension .midi befor save it.

### Fluidsynth

When you load a Sound-font via the Menu -> "Fluidsynth" -> "Load Sound-font" Mamba will start the Fluidsynth engine 
and do the needed connections so that you could just play along. Menu -> "Fluidsynth" -> "Settings" will pop-up
a new Window were you could select the Instrument for the channel and do settings for Fluisynth Reverb and Chorus.
All your Settings will be saved on exit, so on next start you could just play along.
